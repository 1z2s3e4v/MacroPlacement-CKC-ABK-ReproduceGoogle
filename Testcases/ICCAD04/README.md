Here we provide the protobuf and clustered netlist of [ICCAD04](http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/ICCAD04bench/) testcases. We do not include the ibm05 testcase as it does not have any macros. We have utilized [RePlAce](https://github.com/mgwoo/RePlAce/blob/main/RePlAce-static) to generate the initial placement which is required in protobuf netlist. The directory structure is as follows:
- **\<design name\>/\<design name\>.pb.txt**: Protobuf netlist of \<design name\> design.
- **\<design name\>/netlist.pb.txt**: Clustered netlist generated using the [CT-Grouping flow](https://github.com/google-research/circuit_training/tree/main/circuit_training/grouping) when the input is  \<design name\>/\<design name\>.pb.txt.
- **\<design name\>/initial.plc**: This plc file is generated by [CT-Grouping flow](https://github.com/google-research/circuit_training/tree/main/circuit_training/grouping) when the input is \<design name\>/\<design name\>.pb.txt.

\<design name\>/netlist.pb.txt and \<design name\>/initial.plc are the input for CT runs.
