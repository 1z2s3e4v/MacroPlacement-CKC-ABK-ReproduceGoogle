# Circuit Training Model Evaulation

## Quick Start
First, make sure you are under `CodeElements/EvalCT/`. To run `eval_ct.py`, we need to download `circuit_training` code under the same directory. Run the following command to get the stable version that we have tested.
```
# Compatible with Revision #90. Latest Version might cause errors
svn export -r 90 --force https://github.com/google-research/circuit_training.git/trunk/circuit_training
```

Assume you have trained models (which usually can be found under `./logs`)
