# **MacroPlacement**
**MacroPlacement** is an open, transparent effort to provide a public, baseline implementation of [Google Brain's Circuit Training](https://github.com/google-research/circuit_training) (Morpheus) deep RL-based placement method.  We will provide (1) testcases in open enablements, along with multiple EDA tool flows; (2) implementations of missing or binarized elements of Circuit Training; (3) reproducible example macro placement solutions produced by our implementation; and (4) post-routing results obtained by full completion of the place-and-route flow using both proprietary and open-source tools.

## **Testcases**  
The list of avaialbe test cases
- Ariane (RTL)
  - [RTL files for Ariane design with 136 macros](./Testcases/ariane136/) version is generated by instantiating 16-bit memories in Ariane netlist availabe in [lowRISC](https://github.com/lowRISC/ariane) GitHub repository.
  - [RTL files for Ariane designs with 133 macros](./Testcases/ariane133/) version is generated by updating the memory connection of 136 macro version.
- MemPool (RTL)
  - [RTL files for Mempool tile design](./Testcases/mempool_tile/)
  - RTL files for Mempool group design
  
In this [Nature Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w), authors have used Ariane design with 133 memory (256x16, single ported SRAM) macros as one of the test cases. We noticed synthesizing the available Ariane netlist in [lowRISC](https://github.com/lowRISC/ariane) GitHub repository with 256x16 memory results in Ariane design with 136 memory macros ([Here](./Testcases/ariane136/) we show how we instantiate memories for Ariane 136). [Here](./Testcases/ariane133/) we show how we convert the Ariane 136 design to Ariane 133 design. So, we added these two versions to our testcase list. 
MemPool tile design is another testcase and we will be adding MemPool group in this list.  
  

Here we provide the detailed steps to generate the netlist for each test case. This netlist is used for the SP&R runs. The directory structure is as follows *./Testcases/\<testcase\>/<rtl\|sv2v>/*. 
  - *rtl* directory contains all the required rtl files to synthesize the test case.
  - If the main repository contains only the SystemVerilog files, we add the converted Verilog file to the sv2v directory.

## **Enablements**
The list of available enablements
- [NanGate45 Enablements](./Enablements/NanGate45/)
- [ASAP7 Enablements](./Enablements/ASAP7/)
  
 Open-source enablements NanGate45 and ASAP7 (will be adding) are utilized in our SP&R flow. The directory structure is *./Enablements/\<enablement\>/<lib\|lef>/*. Here
 - *lib* directory contains all the required liberty files.
 - *lef* directory contains all the required lef files.
  
Also, we provide steps to generate the fakerams.

## **Flows**
Synthesis, place and route (SP&R) flow is available for each test case on each enablement. Here is the list
- NanGate45
  - [SP&R flows for Ariane design with 136 macros](./Flows/NanGate45/ariane136/)
  - [SP&R flows for Ariane design with 133 macros](./Flows/NanGate45/ariane133/)
  - [SP&R flows for MemPool tile design](./Flows/NanGate45/mempool_tile/)
  - MemPool group

Here we provide detailed information to run SP&R for each test case using the open-source tools Yosys (synthesis) and OpenROAD (P&R), and the commercial tools Cadence Genus (synthesis) and Innovus (P&R).  
The directory structure is as follows *./FLows/\<enablement\>/\<testcase\>/<constraint\|def\|netlist\|scripts\|run>/*. Here
- *constraint* directory contains the *.sdc* file.
- *def* directory contains the def file with pin placement and die area information.
- *scripts* directory contains required scripts to run SP&R using the Cadence and OpenROAD tools.
- *netlist* directory contains the synthesized netlist. We provide a synthesized netlist that can be used to run P&R.
- Also, we provide the *run* directory to run the scripts provided in the *scripts* directory.

## **Code Elements**
The code elements below are most crucial undocumented portions of Circuit Training. We thank Google 
engineers for Q&A in a shared document, as well as live discussions on May 19, 2022, 
that explained the following code elements used in Circuit Training. 
All errors of understanding and implementation are the authors'. 
We will rectify such errors as soon as possible after being made aware of them.


- [Gridding](./CodeElements/Gridding/) determines a dissection of the layout canvas into some number of rows (n_rows) and some number of columns (n_cols) of gridcells. In Circuit Training, the purpose of gridding is to control the size of the macro placement solution space, 
thus allowing RL to train within reasonable runtimes. Gridding enables hard macros to find locations consistent with high solution quality, 
while allowing soft macros (standard-cell clusters) to also find good locations. 

- [Grouping](./CodeElements/Grouping/) ensureS that closely-related logic is kept close to hard macros and to clumps of IOs. The clumps of IOs are induced by IO locations with respect to the row and column coordinates in the gridded layout canvas.

- [Hypergraph clustering](./CodeElements/Clustering/) clusters millions of standard cells into a few thousand clusters.  In Circuit Training, the purpose of clustering is to generate an approximate but fast standard cell placement that facilitates policy networks. 

- [Force-directed placement](./CodeElements/FDPlacement/) places the center of each standard cell cluster onto  centers of gridcells generated by [Gridding](./CodeElements/Gridding/).


- [Simulated annealing](./CodeElements/SimulatedAnnealing/) places the center of each macro onto centers of gridcells generated by [Gridding](./CodeElements/Gridding/).  In Circuit Training,  simulated annealing is used as a baseline to show the relative sample efficiency of RL.

- [LEF/DEF and Bookshelf (OpenDB, RosettaStone) translators](./CodeElements/FormatTranslators/) ease the translation between different representations of the same netlist.

## **FAQ**
**Why are you doing this?**
- The challenges of data and benchmarking in EDA research have, in our view, been contributing factors in the controversy regarding the Nature work. The mission of the TILOS AI Institute includes finding solutions to these challenges -- in high-stakes applied optimization domains (such as IC EDA), and at community-scale. We hope that our effort will become an existence proof for transparency, reproducibility, and democratization of research in EDA.  [We applaud and thank Cadence Design Systems for allowing their tool runscripts to be shared openly by researchers, enabling reproducibility of results obtained via use of Cadence tools.]
- We do understand that Google has been working hard to complete the open-sourcing of Morpheus, and that this effort continues today. However, as pointed out in [this Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vkPRgJEiLIyT22AkQNAxO8JtIKiL95diVdJ_O4AFtJ8/edit?usp=sharing), it has been more than a year since "Data and Code Availability" was committed with publication of the [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03544-w). We consider our work a "backstop" or "safety net" for Google's internal efforts, and a platform for researchers to build on. 

**What can others contribute?**
- Our shopping list includes the following. Please join in! 
  - force-directed placement (and API): documentation and implementation
